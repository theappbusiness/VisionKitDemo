# VisionKitDemo

**VisionKit** is a framework Apple introduced in iOS 13 that lets your app use the system’s document scanner of the system itself  to scan documents or papers.

It has support for OCR (Optical Character Recognition), which allows you to detect and recognise text on scanned documents.

In this repo we will see how to:
- Scan an image/document.
- Extract the text from the scanned document  (using Vision framework) and display it in a textView.
- Explore the LiveText API introduced in iOS 16. This API can recognise any image taken from a camera on the iPhone and grab the data. (You will need Xocde 14 to run this)
